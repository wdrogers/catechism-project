# Editorial Guidelines

### Modernization revisions
1. Produce the first known markdown edition of Saint Philaret's Catechism.
1. Retain visibly the difference between the original text and the adapted text. ~~original~~ ==adapted==
1. Modernize archaic expressions, phrases, and vocabulary where possible, without changing doctrinal intent. *~~Whence~~ ==From what source==*
1. Simplify difficult wording, even if this adjusts the original rhetorical (but not doctrinal) intent.  For example, questions expressed in the negative with the use of the word "not" may be changed where possible to the positive sense.  *Q: Does he ~~not~~ like the color blue? A: Yes, he likes the color blue.*
1. Simplify the vocabulary by choosing more exact or equivalent but more common synonyms.  Simplify difficult phrases. One goal is to maintain or slightly reduce the reading level of the document.
1. Where possible, make the language more gender and age inclusive, such as were people in general are referred to as men.  The goal is that the student, whether man or woman, adult or child, can easily identify with the application of truth to themselves, their peers, and all people.
1. Replace Scriptural quotes with references to the ESV version of the text.  Modify vocabulary of the questions and answers to reflect the choices of the translators, as appropriate.  The goal is to make it easier for the student to see the connection between the taught truth and its Scriptural basis.
1. Expand Scriptural reference, i.e. whole verse instead of partial, where deemed helpful.
1. Add reference information about Saints and important documents that are cited in the Catechism.
1. Add definitions of terms.

### Universal Catechism revisions
1. Modify the catechism to broaden its applicability to every Christian.
1. Leverage the insights of one of the most ecumenical of historically recent theologians, John Wesley, to adapt the content of the catechism for general use.  Refer to the Bible commentaries of John Wesley and Matthew Henry for cited verses to check for interpretive differences.
1. Retain visibly the difference between the original text and the Universal text.  Where Base-revision can be deemed "equivalent" by sufficiently regarded Orthodox representatives, this would lead to a strategy to minimize the apparent differences from actual differences.
1. Engage in scholarly research as needed to maintain doctrinal integrity with the historic, orthodox faith.

### Markdown Conventions
1. Strikethrough original text instead of deleting it, using `~~word~~` to produce ~~world~~.
2. Use highlight to show the new wording, using `==earth==` to produce ==earth==. (This works in some flavors of markdown)
