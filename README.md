# catechism-project
Modernized and universal version of the Catechism of Saint Philaret, also known as the Longer Catechism of the Orthodox, Catholic, Eastern Church.

By *modernized* it is meant that language choices and Bible translations will be updated from the 1800's choices to those of the early twenty-first century. Univerally-recognized Christian terminology is used wherever possible.  The vocabulary used in questions and answers is aligned to the word choices of the Bible translation.

By *universal* it is meant that Biblically-minded Christians who value the historic, orthodox, traditional Christian faith, coming from a variety of backgrounds and valuing Church unity, may find the adaptations to have merit. Likewise, it is our hope that Christians from an Orthodox background will also find the modernization helpful and the adaptations acceptable and valuable, especially when viewed from an ecumenical perspective on the Universal Church.

## Vision
The guiding vision for this project is to provide a modern and comprehensive catechism useful to my own family, and to share it with all who would find benefit from the same.

You are warmly welcomed to this repository, my abode on the internet. The work occurring here is shared as a gift born from Christian love and is my (*our*, counting any contributors) act of service and hospitality.

<blockquote>
<sup>7</sup> The end of all things is at hand; therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers. <sup>8</sup> Above all keep loving one another, since love covers a multitude of sins. <sup>9</sup> Show <i><b>hospitality</b></i> to one another without grumbling. <sup>10</sup> As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God’s varied grace: <sup>11</sup> whoever speaks, as one who utters oracles of God; whoever serves, as one who serves by the strength that God supplies; in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him belong glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. <b>1 Peter 4:7-11 [ESV]</b>
