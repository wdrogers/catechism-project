# catechism-project
Modernized and adapted version of the Catechism of Saint Philaret, also known as the Longer Catechism of the Orthodox, Catholic, Eastern Church.

The guiding vision for this project is to provide a modern and comprehensive catechism useful to my own family, and to share it with all who would find benefit from the same.
